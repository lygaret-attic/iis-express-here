# IIS Express Here

## Wha?

Get an IIS Express process running in the current or selected directory, and open a browser to that site. This is mainly useful when you're 

## Install
- Save `serve.bat` somewhere.
- Update `serve.reg`, changing the paths in the command keys to the location where you saved `serve.bat`
- Apply `serve.reg` to your registry. 

## Use

Right click on either a folder or directory background and select "IIS Express Here"

You'll end up with a nifty cmd window with request logging, and your browser will open to the site you just started serving. Press 'Q' to stop IIS Express when you're finished.
